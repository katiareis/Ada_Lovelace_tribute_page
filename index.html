        <h2 id="headline">Who was Ada Lovelace?</h2>
        <p>
          Augusta Ada King Noel, also known as The Countess of Lovelace and
          better known as Ada Lovelace, was a pioneer in the fields of
          mathematics and science.
        </p>
        <p>
          A feminist, she was known for her strong views on women's rights. She
          herself was a skilled computer programmer and she believed that women
          should be allowed to study science and maths.
        </p>
        <p>
          Augusta Ada King Noel was married to William King-Noel, the first Earl
          of Lovelace, who was also an accomplished nobleman and scientist. Ada
          fought in a male-dominated world to carve a niche for herself. As the
          first ever computer programmer, she made sure that her work was
          relevant for future generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beginning of everything related to the technology we have at our
          disposal today was the result of the work of many people. One of the
          most important contribution was made by Ada Lovelace, who wrote the
          first algorithm in the world. Her contribution to Babbage's analytical
          engine changed the course of everything that was created in the
          following decades.

        <h3>
          Learn a little more about the history of this creative and
          revolutionary woman:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>December 10, 1815</strong> - Ada was born in London,
            England, as Augusta Ada Byron, and was the only legitimate child of
            Lord George Gordon Byron, the poet, and his wife Lady Annabella
            Byron. She is remembered for being the daughter of Lord Byron, but
            her father was not a great example to her: in fact, she was raised
            by her mother, also mathematician Anne Isabella Milbanke.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1828</strong> - At the age of 12, Ada Byron designs and
            begins to construct a flying machine.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1833</strong> - Ada Byron meets Charles Babbage,
            mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer. They
            begin to collaborate and correspond by letter, and Babbage writes to
            a friend that he has met "the Enchantress of Number."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1835</strong> - Ada Byron marries William King and adds King
            to her name.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1836</strong> - On May 12, her first child, Byron, is born.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1837</strong> - On September 22, her second child, Anna
            Isabella (Annabella) is born.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1838</strong> - Ada Byron King's husband is named Count of
            Lovelace and she becomes Ada Lovelace, the name by which she is most
            commonly known today.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1839</strong> - On July 2, her third child, Ralph Gordon, is
            born.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1842-1843</strong> - Ada Lovelace translates, over the
            course of 9 months, the article by Luigi Menabrea, the Italian
            mathematician, on Babbage's proposed Analytical Machine.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1843</strong> - Ada Lovelace adds a set of notes, around 3
            times longer than the translation of Menabrea's paper. In the last
            section, she writes a complete method to solving for a Bernoulli
            sequence on the Analytical Engine, later found to be correct.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1844</strong> - Ada Lovelace writes to a friend regarding
            her wish to mathematically model the brain, developing a "calculus
            of the nervous system."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1851</strong> - Ada Lovelace attempts to derive a
            mathematical model to win large bets, but loses a great deal of
            money and must admit her gambling to her husband.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1852</strong> - On November 27, Ada Lovelace dies from
            uterine cancer, exacerbated by bloodletting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1953</strong> - Ada Lovelace's notes on the Analytical
            Engine are republished, and she becomes known as the first writer of
            an algorithm specifically designed to run on a computer.
          </li>
        </ul>
