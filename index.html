            <p>
              Augusta Ada King Noel, also known as The Countess of Lovelace and
              better known as Ada Lovelace, was a pioneer in the fields of
              mathematics and science.
            </p>
            <p>
              A feminist, she was known for her strong views on women's rights. She
              herself was a skilled computer programmer and she believed that women
              should be allowed to study science and maths.
            </p>
            <p>
              Augusta Ada King Noel was married to William King-Noel, the first Earl
              of Lovelace, who was also an accomplished nobleman and scientist. Ada
              fought in a male-dominated world to carve a niche for herself. As the
              first ever computer programmer, she made sure that her work was
              relevant for future generations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The beginning of everything related to the technology we have at our
              disposal today was the result of the work of many people. One of the
              most important contribution was made by Ada Lovelace, who wrote the
              first algorithm in the world. Her contribution to Babbage's analytical
              engine changed the course of everything that was created in the
              following decades.

            Byron. She is remembered for being the daughter of Lord Byron, but
            her father was not a great example to her: in fact, she was raised
            by her mother, also mathematician Anne Isabella Milbanke.

            <p>Ada Byron was a teenager when she met Cambridge mathematics professor Charles Babbage, who had invented the Difference Engine, a mechanical computer designed to produce mathematical tables automatically and error-free. Babbage never built the actual machine due to personal setbacks and financing difficulty. By 1834 he had moved on to design his Analytical Engine, the first general purpose computer, which used punch cards for input and output. This machine also lacked financing and was never built. (Babbage's Difference Engine was finally constructed in 1985–2002, and it worked.)</p>

            <p>Babbage was impressed with the brilliant young woman, and they corresponded for years, discussing math and computing as he developed the Analytical Engine. In 1842, Babbage gave a lecture on the engine at the University of Turin. Luigi Menabrea, a mathematician (and future Italian prime minister), transcribed the lecture in French. Ada, now in her late 20s and known as Countess of Lovelace, was commissioned to translate the transcript into English. Lovelace added her own notes to the lecture, which ended up being three times as long as the actual transcript. It was published in 1843. </p>
